# Welcome to Mod 1!
## Commit

This is the primary repository you will use throughout module 1 at Turing.

You will find almost all the interactive resources you will need here, and the rest on the [Turing Curriculum Website](https://curriculum.turing.edu/module1/).

## Setup
You should fork this repository and then clone YOUR fork to your computer. Make sure you don't clone the turingschool-examples repository.

You can confirm that you have cloned the correct repository by running `git remote -v`. You should see something like this:

  ```
  origin	git@github.com:<YOUR_USERNAME>/se-mod1-exercises.git (fetch)
  origin	git@github.com:<YOUR_USERNAME>/se-mod1-exercises.git (push)
  ```

Each section has its own README to describe how to best use the provided resources. Let's take a look around.

## Table of Contents

### Lessons

You will find the starter code for many of your lessons in the [Lessons](./lessons) directory. Often, instructors will do code-alongs during lessons, and it can be helpful to follow along and take notes of your own.

### Practice Ruby Exercises

This is a collection of exercises to practice various aspects of Ruby. Each folder in [Ruby Exercises](./ruby_exercises) is a set of related exercises. Open up the folder and read the README to learn more about them.

### Practice Independent Challenges

In week 6, students will participate in the Final Independent Challenge (also called Final Assessment) that will count towards the promotion decision. This 3 hour code challenge that students will complete independently, meaning the student cannot seek help from other students, mentors, etc. Students are allowed to reference notes, other projects, and the internet.

In order to practice for the Final Independent Challenge in week 6, students will be given a weekly practice Independent Challenge starting in week 2. They will be submitted using a Github Pull Request, and instructors will give feedback in various forms. These are not formal assessments, but an opportunity for the student to practice their problem solving skills and receive feedback from instructors. Students are expected to complete the first three iterations.

Students can find examples of Independent Challenges in the [Practice Independent Challenges](./practice_independent_challenges) directory.
